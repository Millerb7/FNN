## Introduction

A Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) is a type of artificial neural network designed for making predictions, classifications, or approximations based on input data. This document outlines the key components and steps involved in creating an FNN.

## FNN Components

### Input Layer

- The input layer represents the features from the dataset.
- The number of nodes in this layer corresponds to the dimensionality of the input data.

### Hidden Layers

- Hidden layers are intermediate layers between the input and output layers.
- Each hidden layer consists of multiple neurons (nodes) that apply activation functions.

### Neurons in Hidden Layers

- Each neuron in a hidden layer receives input from all neurons in the previous layer.
- Neurons calculate their inputs as weighted sums of the outputs from the previous layer's neurons, plus a bias term.

### Activation Functions

- Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the model.
- Common activation functions include ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh.
- Activation functions are applied to the weighted sums of inputs to produce neuron outputs.

### Output Layer

- The output layer produces the final result of the FNN.
- The number of neurons in this layer depends on the problem type (e.g., one neuron for binary classification).
- Activation functions (e.g., sigmoid or softmax) are used in the output layer.

### Weights and Biases

- Connections between neurons have weights that represent connection strengths.
- Each neuron has a bias term.
- Weights and biases are adjusted during training to optimize the FNN's performance.

## Training Process

### Forward Propagation

- During forward propagation, input data flows through the FNN from the input layer to the output layer.
- Neurons compute inputs, apply activation functions, and pass outputs to the next layer.

### Loss Function

- The loss function measures the difference between FNN predictions and actual target values.
- Common loss functions for binary classification include binary cross-entropy.

### Backpropagation

- Backpropagation computes gradients of the loss function with respect to weights and biases.
- Gradients guide weight and bias updates during training.

### Training

- Training involves iteratively feeding training data, computing gradients, and updating weights and biases to minimize the loss.
- Optimization algorithms like gradient descent are used for training.

## Evaluation

- After training, the FNN is evaluated using a separate testing dataset to assess its performance on unseen data.
