## Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (recommended version: 3.x)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) (for numerical operations)

## Dataset

Select or create a simple dataset for binary classification. You can use libraries like scikit-learn to generate synthetic datasets. Provide a brief description of the dataset here.

## Neural Network Architecture

Define the architecture of your FNN:

- Input Layer: [Number of input features]
- Hidden Layers: [Number of hidden layers], [Number of neurons per hidden layer]
- Output Layer: 1 neuron with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

## Training

1. Initialize weights and biases randomly.
2. Implement forward propagation.
3. Define the loss function (e.g., binary cross-entropy).
4. Implement backpropagation to calculate gradients.
5. Update weights and biases using gradient descent or an optimization algorithm (e.g., SGD).
6. Create a training loop that iterates through the dataset, logging the training loss.

## Evaluation

After training, evaluate your FNN on a separate validation or test dataset:

- Measure performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
- Provide evaluation results and insights.

## Fine-Tuning

Experiment with different hyperparameters, such as:

- Learning rate
- Number of hidden layers
- Number of neurons in hidden layers

Optimize your FNN's performance and document the changes made.

## Documentation

1. Document your code with comments and explanations for each step.
2. Write a report summarizing your FNN implementation, dataset, results, and insights gained during the process.

## Optional Enhancements

If you feel comfortable, consider adding optional enhancements to your FNN, such as:

- Dropout layers
- Batch normalization
- Experimenting with different activation functions
