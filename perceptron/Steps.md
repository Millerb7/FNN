# Project Setup and Environment

- Set up your Python environment with libraries like NumPy for numerical computations.

# Design the Perceptron

- Decide on the architecture of your single-layer perceptron.
- Determine the number of input features (e.g., `num_features`) and initialize weights and bias.

# Initialize Weights and Bias

- Initialize the weight vector (e.g., `weights`) with small random values.
- Initialize the bias (e.g., `bias`) to zero.

# Implement Perceptron Activation

- Write a function that computes the weighted sum of inputs plus the bias (perceptron activation).
- The activation can be calculated as:
  ```python
  activation = sum(weight[i] * input[i] for i in range(num_features)) + bias

# Implement Threshold Activation Function

- Write a function that applies a threshold to the activation to produce binary outputs (e.g., 0 or 1).

# Forward Propagation

- Write a function for forward propagation that computes the perceptron's output for a given input.

# Define Loss Function

- Choose a loss function appropriate for binary classification.
- For a perceptron, you can use a simple threshold-based loss (e.g., 0 for correct classification, 1 for misclassification).

# Calculate Loss

- Write a function that calculates the loss by comparing the predicted output to the actual label for a given input.

# Update Weights and Bias

- Implement the weight and bias update rule for the perceptron. For example:
    ```python
    weight[i] = weight[i] + learning_rate * (actual_output - predicted_output) * input[i] - bias = bias + learning_rate * (actual_output - predicted_output)

# Training Loop

- Set up a training loop that iterates over your dataset for a fixed number of epochs. In each epoch, perform forward propagation, calculate the loss, update weights and bias, and track the training progress.

# Stop Criterion

- Define a stopping criterion for training, such as reaching a maximum number of epochs or achieving a certain accuracy threshold.
